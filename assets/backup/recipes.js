        "<p>Start off by heating up a large pan with a tablespoon of olive oil.Add your onion and garlic to the pan and cook until fragrant. If youre using fresh jalapeno, add those in to cook as well. If you prefer or only have pickled jalapenos, add them in last to retain flavor!Once your veggies are cooked down a bit, add in your ground beef and break it up in the pan.After the meat is nice and brown, stir in your marinara sauce, mustard, soy sauce, vinegar and sriracha and lower the heat to simmer.Add in your brown sugar substitute and your seasoning and stir it all in.Let this simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes or until a lot of the liquid has evaporated and everything has become thick and sticky. Add in pickled jalapeno right before serving.When youre ready to serve, spoon some of the Sloppy Joe onto an Oopsie roll, low carb wrap, a leaf of lettuce or right into a bowl! Enjoy!</p>",
        "You will need two 9X5 non-stick loaf pans. Spray each with non-stick pan spray and line the inside with cut pieces of parchment paper so the paper sticks out of the pans on the long sides. These will act as handles to remove the bread once baked.Make the Biga pre-fermentation the day before by combining the flour, yeast and water. Mix by hand or with a stand mixer with a dough hook to form a dough that sticks a little to the bottom while mixing. Add more water or flour to achieve that consistency. Place in an oiled covered bowl and set in a warm place for an hour or two until doubled in size. Punch down, cover and place in the refrigerator overnight.Four to five hours before serving, remove Biga from the refrigerator and cut into golf ball sized pieces and lay out on your counter. Cover with plastic and a towel and let come up to room temperature for 45 minutes.While Biga is coming to room temperature, measure out all of your ingredients and prepare milk and butter by combining in a microwave safe bowl and microwaving until hot and the butter has melted. Set aside to cool to room temperature.In a small bowl, combine warm water and yeast.In a medium bowl, combine eggs, egg yolks, sugar and salt. Using an electric mixer or by hand whip for about three minutes or until the mixture turns pale.To the egg mixture, add nutmeg, both extracts, both zests and orange liquor and stir to combine.Place 5 cups of flour on your counter and make a large well in the center or in a stand mixer.Mix and stir as you go and add each of the three bowls a little at a time starting with warm yeast and water, then cooled milk and butter and finally eggs and sugar mixture, pulling the sides into the center over and over to form a dough or beat with a dough hook in your stand mixer.Add the pieces of Biga to the dough working them in as you press and turn or with stand mixer. Use remaining  cup of flour if needed to make somewhat of a sticky but manageable dough.The dough will be at the top of a five quart mixer and will need to be kneaded by hand at this point. This process will take a good five minutes working the dough to knead and blend together. Pour the dough onto a floured surface. Pull the back of the dough to the front and press with the heel of your palm over and over working the dough for five minutes. This step is necessary.Oil a large bowl and place the dough ball in and swirl to coat all sides with oil.Cover with plastic and a towel and place in a warm place for at least two hours or until doubled in size.In a medium bowl place both raisins, currants and rum, cover and microwave one minute on high. Add butter, cinnamon, sugar and salt and stir into warm raisin mixture. Once butter has melted in, place entire contents in a food processor and pure for about 30 seconds to form a spreadable paste. Reserve  cup of this mixture and set the rest aside.Once the dough has doubled in size, generously flour your counter and pour out the dough. Cut into two equal pieces.One at a time, roll out each piece of dough to 12 inches by 24 inches.Take half of the remaining raisin mixture and with an offset spatula, spread to within an inch of the edge of the first rolled out dough. Sprinkle the top with half the nuts.Roll the long edge tightly to the other long edge so you have one 24 inch long tight roll. Cut this in half so you have two 12 inch rolls.Take half of the reserved  cup of the raisin filling and smear it over the top of one of the rolls. Take the other roll and place it over the first in an X shape.Now twist each end around each other so you have a striped twisted roll. Cut off and discard about an inch or so of each end. Lift the twisted roll and place in prepared pan pressing it in to fit.Repeat this procedure for the other loaf.Cover with plastic and a dish towel and let proof for 90 minutes or until almost doubled in size.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.Beat the egg with the water and brush the tops of each loaf, trying not to let the egg wash leak down the sides.Place in the center of the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes or until golden brown and when tapped, sounds hollow. Half way through baking, rotate pans so that they brown evenly. Ours took 38 minutes total.Cool for a few minutes on a rack then pull out of the pan lifting out with the paper. Place on rack while you make glaze.Place butter and milk in a sauce pan and heat and whip. Once butter melts, add the remaining glaze ingredients whipping as you go.Spoon warm glaze over warm bread letting glaze drizzle down the sides. Cool to room temperature.Once cool, bread should be tightly wrapped. Can be frozen if baking ahead.",
        "* For simple syrup - Combine equal amounts of sugar and water and several sprigs of spearmint (tied in cheesecloth) in a small saucepan over medium heat until sugar melts.  Cook it a few minutes to get a thicker syrup.  Remove from the heat.  Let this mixture steep for awhile.  You can taste it and see if it is minty enough for your taste.  Remove the mint from the syrup.  Transfer to a container and refrigerate overnight.For cocktail:Place crushed ice in a silver cup, preferably.  Pour in bourbon and mint simple syrup.  Stir.  Add club soda, if desired.  Garnish with fresh mint.Enjoy!",
        "Preheat oven to 375F. Spray a 9-inch pie dish (or similar-sized oven-safe baking dish) with cooking spray. Place tortilla chips in dish so they cover the majority of the bottom, slightly overlapping. This prevents soup from seeping through. Add the soup and lightly spread it evenly over the chips with a spatula or knife. Evenly sprinkle the fajita mix over the top. Evenly sprinkle not quite half the cheese over the top (I used about 40% of the bag); set aside remainder. Add the cream cheese in about 1/4 cup blobs and with a spatula or knife, do your best to carefully distribute it evenly over the pan without disturbing the other layers. Some small bald patches are okay because it bakes together. Tip - the softer your cream cheese is, the easier this step is. Evenly pour the salsa over the top, spreading it lightly with a spatula or knife if necessary. Evenly sprinkle reserved cheese over the top. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until top is golden browned, bubbly, and dip is done to your liking. Allow dip to cool momentarily before serving. Serving Suggestions - tortilla chips, bread, crackers, bagel chips, pita chips, mini toast crackers, carrot/celery/zucchni/jicama/cucumber sticks, bell pepper wedges, or eat by the spoonful. Dip is best warm and fresh, but extra will keep airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Gently re-heat in micro before serving leftover portion. We ate the leftover portion in squares like lasagna.",

If you prefer a thinner cornbread, use a larger skillet and adjust down the baking time a bit. (If you do not have a cast iron skillet, use a round or square 8- or 9-inch baking dish.)Place the oiled skillet in the oven while you mix the bread. (Pouring the batter into a piping hot greased skillet is the key to a crunchy exterior on your cornbread.)In a mixing bowl, combine dry ingredients; whisk to blend.Add eggs (or replacer), milk and oil; stir until batter is smooth.Carefully remove hot skillet with oil from the oven, place it on a heat-proof surface, then pour the cornbread batter slowly into the skillet - if you use an 8-inch cast iron skillet, your batter will reach the top edge - don't worry , it will not overflow!Again, being very careful with the hot skillet, return it to the oven.Bake 30 minutes, then remove cornbread and allow to cool for a few minutes before cutting into wedges.Serve with a drizzle of honey or maple syrup, or alongside your favorite soup or stew!",

        "Drain the shucked oysters from the plastic container, and give them a gentle rinse with cold water. The oysters are very delicate, so be careful handling them. Place the oysters in a colander, and let the excess water drain for at least 10 minutes.\nPrepare the batter by mixing  cup flour, the baking powder, white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and salt until well-combined.\nHeat the oil to 350 degrees F in a small (to save oil) but deep pot (to prevent splattering). Check the oil temperature with a candy or oil thermometer for accuracy.\nRight before youre ready to fry the oysters, add the cold seltzerit makes for a crispier oyster. Mix until your batter is smooth (a few small lumps here and there is fine). Then, mix in the sesame oil.\nAfter the oysters have drained, lightly pat each of them dry with a paper towel, and dredge each oyster lightly with flour. I know its tempting to dredge all of the oysters at once in a glob, but its best to dredge each oyster individually just before you batter and fry them to ensure they are fully and evenly coated.\nAfter dredging, dip each oyster into the batter so it is fully coated. Lift them out of the batter carefully--you can use the edge of the bowl to scrape off excess batter if needed.\nNow youre ready to deep fry the oysters. Check the temperature of the oil again with your thermometer. As you are frying, you should adjust the heat to maintain a temperature between 325 degrees F and 350 degrees F, because the oil will cool quickly as you drop in the battered oysters and then quickly heat again as they cook.\nLower the oyster halfway into the oil and slowly swirl it for 2 or 3 seconds so the batter cooks slightly, and then drop it into the oil. This process prevents the oyster from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Fry the oysters in batches, depending upon the size of your pot and the amount of oil you are using. For this recipe, we fried oysters in batches of 3 or 4 depending upon their size.\nUse a slotted spoon to lift the oysters out when they are golden brown and transfer them to a metal cooling rack to drain. Repeat until all the oysters have been fried.\nNow you can make the dipping sauce. In a small saucepan, add the ketchup, soy sauce, rice vinegar, salt, sugar, and cornstarch slurry and heat to a simmer. You can adjust the flavor by either adding vinegar to make it more tart, adding sugar if you like it sweeter, or adding more cornstarch and water if you like it thicker.\nIts best to serve these immediately, but if you are like us on Chinese New Year, you are preparing many dishes at the same time, and its inevitable that these wont get eaten immediately! So just before serving, you can reheat your oil to 375 degrees F, and drop the oysters in 3 or 4 at a time, frying them for 30 seconds or until they are crisp again. Alternatively, you can heat them in a toaster oven at 400 degrees F for 5 minutes.\nServe these deep fried oysters on a bed of iceberg lettuce, and garnish with chopped scallions. The dipping sauce should be served warm, so reheat your dipping sauce if needed.",

        "Cut the tortillas to approximately 4-inch diameter circles (it's a good idea to put them on a cutting board and, using a plate as a template, slice around the tortilla with the tip of a sharp paring knife).                          Spread the tortillas on a dry surface for about 2 hours to let them dry; this will prevent them from splattering. In a skillet or electric fryer, heat 1-inch of oil to 375 degrees F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until the surface of the oil begins to shimmer -- if it smokes, it's too hot. Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and hold it submerged with a pair of tongs for 20 seconds. Continue to fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it turns golden brown and floats to the top of the oil, surrounded by a thin ring of tiny bubbles. Flip the tortilla over and fry for 30 seconds to tan the other side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.

Cut the potatoes in half and set aside; coarsely chop when cool enough to handle.Meanwhile, heat 1 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add catfish and cook, stirring often, until just cooked through and opaque, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon and discard any liquid in the pan. Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil, bell pepper, scallions and ham and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are soft, about 4 minutes.Return the catfish to the pan along with the chopped potatoes, mustard, salt and pepper. Continue to cook, stirring gently, until combined and heated through, about 2 minutes more. Serve with lemon wedges.",
        "Peel and cook the potatoes in a large pot of slightly salted, boiling water, until almost cooked through.  About 10 minutes. Drain well and coarsely mash.Melt butter in a large non-stick skillet and saute onion over medium low heat for 15 minutes until soft and golden.  Add the potatoes to the pan with salt and pepper, to taste. Cook stirring and mashing the potatoes occasionally, for 15 to 20 minutes until well-browned and crisp around the edges.Meanwhile, put the sausages in a roasting pan and drizzle with half the oil, and roast in a 400 degree oven for 25 minutes.Half the tomatoes and put them in a shallow baking dish.  Drizzle with the remaining oil and put them on the top shelf of the oven after the sausages have been cooking 5 minutes.  Cook the tomatoes for 15 minutes, then drizzle over the balsamic vinegar and cook for 5 more minutes.Fry the eggs to your liking (I love a runny yolk!) and serve over the onion hash alongside the sausage and tomatoes.",
        "Set oven to 400FPeel and slice the onion into 3/8 inch slices.  Carefully separate the rings.Grind the nuts in a small food processor until finely ground, but don't let the machine go so long that it becomes a paste.  If you are making your own cracker crumbs, grind a handful of plain crackers, salted is fine, in the same processor.  Process until finely ground.  You will need 1 cup.Stir the nuts and the crumbs together in a shallow pan.Whisk the egg and buttermilk together in another shallow pan.  Put the onion rings right into the buttermilk mixture and let them hang out there.Coat the bottom of a baking sheet with the oil and set it in the oven for 3 minutes. You are going to need 2 trays, or you can work in batches.Take an onion ring from the liquid and let the excess drip off.   Dredge it in the crumb mixture. This works best if you keep one hand for the liquid and one hand stays dry for the crumbs.  Quickly toss the onion in the crumbs making sure to coat all the surfaces.  Set it on the hot pan.  When you have filled the pan, bake for about 12 minutes, carefully flipping the rings halfway through the cooking.Drain on paper towels, and serve right away.",

Transfer to a bowl, season to taste with salt and pepper.Combine spring salad mix, mozzarella and prosciutto in a salad bowl.    Drizzle tomato vinaigrette over the top. Toss to coat. Sprinkle with fresh cracked pepper. Serve.",
        "1. Make the Crust: Process  cup of the flour, salt, and sugar together in food processor until combined, about 2 one-second pulses. Add butter and shortening and process for 10 seconds (dough will resemble cottage cheese curds with some very small pieces of butter remaining, but there should be no uncoated flour). Scrape down sides and bottom of bowl with a rubber spatula and redistribute dough evenly around processor blade. Add remaining  cup flour and pulse until mixture is evenly distributed around bowl and mass of dough has been broken up, 4 to 6 quick pulses. Empty mixture into medium bowl.2. Sprinkle vodka and water over mixture. With rubber spatula, use folding motion to mix, pressing down on dough until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Flatten dough into 4-inch disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 45 minutes (or up to 2 days).3. On a floured work surface, roll the dough into a 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch pie plate and gently ease the dough into the pie plate. Leave any dough that overhangs the plate in place, wrap the dough-lined pie plate loosely in plastic wrap and refrigerate until the dough is firm, about 30 minutes.4. Trim the overhang to -inch beyond the lip of the pie plate. Tuck the overhang under itself (the folded edge should be flush with the edge of the pie plate). Crimp the dough around the edges. Wrap the dough-lined pie plate loosely in the plastic and place in the freezer for at least 1 hour.5. Meanwhile, Prepare the Filling: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. In a small bowl, whisk together the sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with the lemon juice to coat. Add the sugar mixture and toss together until all of the apples are evenly coated with the mixture.6. Make the Walnut Crumble Topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugars, cinnamon and salt. Add chilled butter cubes; using a pastry blender or two knives, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles wet sand. Stir in the chopped walnuts.7. Bake the Pie: Toss the apple mixture to redistribute juices and turn into the chilled pie crust. Drizzle with the maple syrup and dot with the butter. Cover the filling with the crumble mixture, gently pressing it into the filling.8. Place the pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until the topping is golden, about 40 minutes (cover the top with foil if you find it is browning too quickly). Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue to bake until the apples in the center are tender when pierced with a knife and the filling is bubbling thickly around the edges, about 45 minutes. Allow to cool until barely warm before, about 2 hours. The pie is best the same day it is made; leftovers can be covered tightly and kept at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 2 days.Note: The vodka in the pie crust evaporates and helps to create a light, flaky crust. If you are opposed to using alcohol, you can substitute the same amount of ice water.",
        "Bring vinegar, 1/2 cup water, sugar, peppercorns, salt, allspice, garlic, and bay leaf to a boil in saucepan. Add onion slices, and return to a boil. Remove from heat, and transfer to bowl or jar. Cover, and cool. Let stand at room temperature 24 hours before serving. Onions will keep up to 2 weeks in fridge.",
        "In a 6qt ducth oven, paella pan, or any other pan you may have, over medium to high heat add the chopped chorizo and cook until fragrant and crispy, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan and set aside.Add the olive oil and add the onion, carrots, garlic and cook for 5-7 minutes until translucent. Add the barley, tomato paste, chorizo, peas, salt and stir. Add 5 cups of hot water. Bring to a simmer, cover and cook adding more liquid as it evaporates doing this until the barley is tender.With the type of barley I used my cooking time was about 30 minutes until the barley become tender, however, using other varieties may take up to 50 minutes. When the barley is tender add the clams, parsley and pepper flakes if using. Stir and serve while still warm with lemon wedges.NOTE: I do most of my shopping at Trader Joes. While you can find certain items I used for this recipe on Amazon they are extremely cheaper at the store."
