        "Cut the tortillas to approximately 4-inch diameter circles (it's a good idea to put them on a cutting board and, using a plate as a template, slice around the tortilla with the tip of a sharp paring knife).                          Spread the tortillas on a dry surface for about 2 hours to let them dry; this will prevent them from splattering. In a skillet or electric fryer, heat 1-inch of oil to 375 degrees F. If you do not have a thermometer, wait until the surface of the oil begins to shimmer -- if it smokes, it's too hot. Drop a tortilla into the hot oil and hold it submerged with a pair of tongs for 20 seconds. Continue to fry for 1 to 2 minutes, until it turns golden brown and floats to the top of the oil, surrounded by a thin ring of tiny bubbles. Flip the tortilla over and fry for 30 seconds to tan the other side. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.                          In a bowl, dissolve the espresso powder in 2 teaspoons of hot water. Mix the mascarpone and confectioners' sugar and fold in the dissolved espresso powder with a rubber spatula. Cover and chill for at least 1 hour or overnight.                          Set a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat to 350 degrees F. Place the tortillas on an ungreased cookie sheet. Mix the cinnamon and sugar together and sprinkle the sugar mix over the fried tortillas. Bake for 4 minutes or until the sugar just melts. Just before serving, spread the flavored mascarpone on 6 of the tortillas. Arrange the berries or fruit on the mascarpone and place the remaining tortillas on top, sugared side up.",
        "In a large pot (6 quarts or larger), brown the Italian Sausage over medium heat (3  minutes).Add the onion, celery and carrots; cook 10 minutes stirring frequently.Add the tomatoes and cook 5 minutes; stirring frequently.Add the cannellini beans, chicken broth and 1 quart water.  Turn heat to high, bring to a boil then reduce heat bringing the soup to a simmer.  Simmer for 5 minutes.Add the kale leaves, stirring to combine with soup.   Simmer for 20 minutes.Add salt and pepper (taste to ensure it meets your personal preference).",
        "Heat waffle iron on high heat. I set mine to 5 (out of 6). Preheat oven to 250 degrees.Add the dry ingredients to a medium bowl. Stir. In a microwave-safe bowl, melt butter, about 45 seconds. Add in milk and continue to cook for another minute.Whisk in egg, orange juice, and vanilla extract until combined. Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Be careful not to over mix. Tiny lumps may remain. Add batter to heated waffle iron. I typically err on the side of adding less batter. Remove cooked waffle and place on a baking sheet without stacking. Stacking causes waffles to become limp due to the steam. Place in oven to keep warm. Repeat. Top with fruit and 100% pure maple syrup. Save leftovers in the fridge and reheat by placing the waffle back in the griddle or heat on the stovetop to ensure crispiness. Heating in the microwave will cause waffles to soften.",
        "1.   Prepare almonds: Heat honey and butter in medium skillet and let sizzle until it becomes lightly browned (careful not to burn). Turn off heat and stir in vanilla. In a small bowl, mix together salt, cinnamon and cayenne. Add almonds to the honey mixture and stir quickly to coat. Sprinkle spices evenly over almonds. Remove spiced-up almonds to a greased baking sheet, spread out and let cool. Chop into small pieces when almonds are cool.2.   Prepare shortbread: Mix butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy. Add in flour and salt and continue mixing until dough begins to come together, scraping sides as needed. Mix in cacao nibs, toffee bits and chopped almonds until well combined.3.   Divide shortbread dough in half and turn out onto two pieces of waxed paper. Form into two 8x2 1/2-inch logs, rolling carefully with your hands until well shaped/rounded. Wrap waxed paper around each log and twist ends to seal. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days.4.   When ready to bake, preheat oven to 300°F. With a sharp knife, carefully cut 1/4-inch slices from shortbread log and arrange on parchment-lined sheets. The dough will be thick and chunky, so you can use your fingers to help seal the edges of the cookies if they lose their shape or crumble when slicing. Refrigerate until the oven is well-heated. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until edges begin to brown lightly and dough is set.5.   Remove cookies to a wire rack. Cool for about ten minutes. Mix powdered sugar/cinnamon in low, flat bowl. Dunk top of each cookie in the sugar mixture and return to wire rack to cool completely.",
        "In food processor (or blender), combine vinegar, lime juice, chipotle peppers, garlic cloves, cumin, oregano, pepper, salt and ground cloves. Process on high until smooth.In large crockpot, add roast, pepper puree, bay leaves, and chicken broth. Heat on low 6-8 hours. Shred beef and place back in juice, remove bay leaves. Serve on a tortilla with cilanto-lime rice, colby cheese, lettuce and guacamole. Enjoy!!!Combine rice, water, butter and salt in large saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce to low and simmer for 20 minutes. When done, add lime juice and cilantro. Yum.",

        "Combine the soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sugar and salt in a bowl and set aside.To prepare the noodles, bring the stock to a boil in a medium saucepan. Add the noodles and turn off the heat. Don't break the noodles apart to fit into the pan. They will begin to soften as soon as you add them to the stock. Within 5-6 minutes the noodles will be soft enough to use. Because you'll be using the remaining stock (you should have about ¾ - 1 cup left), drain the noodles on a strainer over a bowl to save the unabsorbed stock. Set aside.While you wait for the noodles to soften, start cooking the meat and vegetables. In a wok or skillet large enough to accommodate the noodles (I used a well-seasoned cast iron skillet) add 1 tablespoon of the oil and heat to medium-high. Add the raw shrimp and cook for a minute or two on each side. You can also add the barbecue pork halfway through the cooking time just to heat up the meat if it's cold (mine came from the refrigerator). Remove the cooked shrimp and heated pork from the skillet and set aside.If the pan needs more oil, add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil (still on medium-high heat). Add the carrots and celery and cook for roughly 2 minutes before adding the curry powder. Cook for about 30 seconds, just until the curry is fragrant then add the remaining stock (start with ¾ cup if you ended up with more after soaking the noodles), soy sauce mixture and bring to a boil.Add the drained noodles, shrimp and pork and cook on high heat until all the stock has evaporated, stir frying the entire time using a flat spatula to prevent the noodles from sticking to the bottom of the skillet. This will take about 2-3 minutes. Turn off the heat and stir in the green onions and sprouts into the noodles right before plating. Serve in individual plates or in a large platter for serving family style. Will serve up to 4 adults if being served with another dish.",
        "Heat olive oil in a large pot or dutch oven over medium heat. Add onions, carrots, celery, salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes until the vegetables are beginning to soften and onions are translucent. Add garlic and cook, stirring for 1 minute or until fragrant.Add the wine and scrape any brown bits off the bottom of the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes or until wine has reduced by about half.Add lentils, bulgur, sweet potato, broth, parsley, and thyme and increase heat to high. Bring to a boil and then reduce to medium-low to simmer for 30 minutes or until lentils are tender, stirring occasionally. Add more water during the cooking process as needed (I needed to add two cups) to keep the lentils just barely covered with liquid.Add baby kale and cover for 1-2 minutes. Uncover, stir, and repeat as needed until kale is wilted. Sprinkle in lemon juice and stir to combine. Taste and add salt and pepper as needed.Serve garnished with plain yogurt and fresh parsley. Store leftovers covered in fridge for up to a week.",
        "Cream together the butter and the sugar.Add in the vanilla, honey, and cinnamon.In a separate bowl combine the salt and the flour.Add to the wet mixture and combine.Place the dough into the fridge to chill for at least one half hour.Bring back out, tear off a generous hunk and roll out on a well floured surface to about 1/2\" thick.Cut out desired shapes and place them on a greased cookie sheet.Bake in a 350 degree oven for 8 minutes.",
        "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray.Mix together the ground turkey, onion, garlic, ginger, egg, panko, salt, pepper, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Knead with your hands to combine well.With your hands, grab meat and roll into 1 inch meatballs. Place on the baking sheet. Don't let them touch, but they can be close together.Place the meatballs in the oven and cook for 20-25 minutes until cooked through. Set aside.In a medium saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the pineapple juice, water, brown sugar, vinegar and soy sauce until sugar is fully dissolved. Whisk in the cornstarch and raise the heat to medium high. Bring to a boil, stirring continuously.Stir in the pineapple bits and the peppers. Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook for 15 minutes. Add meatballs and recover. Cook for an additional 5 minutes.Serve with rice.",
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat egg whites until foamy. Add the cream of tartar and beat until fluffy.Add the sugar very slowly, about 1 tablespoon at a time while still beating.Add the vanilla extract and continue beating until the meringue is shiny.Fold in the chocolate chips.Drop by heaping teaspoons onto cookie sheet and place about 1-inch apart.Place baking sheets in the preheated oven and turn the oven off.Leave the cookies undisturbed in the oven for at least 2 hours.",
        "1. Spray a 9-inch springform pan with sides 2 1/2 to 3 inches deep with nonstick cooking spray. Wrap the pan with a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil to prevent leakage. Have ready one 12-by-2-inch round cake pan or roasting pan.Make the gingersnap crust2. Set an oven rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).3. Spread the pecans evenly on a baking sheet and bake for about 7 minutes to enhance their flavor. Stir once or twice to ensure even toasting. Transfer to a plate and let cool before using.4. In a food processor, combine the gingersnap crumbs, pecans, sugar, and salt and process until fine crumbs form, about 20 seconds. Add the melted butter and pulse just until incorporated, about 10 times.5. Using your fingers or the back of a spoon, press the crumb mixture into the bottom of the pan and partway up the sides. To keep the crumbs from sticking to your fingers, place a piece of plastic wrap over the crumbs and press them through the wrap. Using a flat-bottomed, straight-sided measuring cup or a 6-inch round cake pan, smooth the crumbs evenly over the bottom of the pan and at least 1 1/2 inches up the sides.Make the pumpkin filling6. In a small heavy saucepan over medium heat, stir together the pumpkin and sugar and bring the mixture to a sputtering simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, until thick and shiny, 3 to 5 minutes.7. Using a silicone spatula, scrape the mixture into a large food processor and process for 1 minute with the feed tube open. With the motor running, add the cold cream. Then add the cream cheese in several pieces and process for 30 seconds, or until smoothly incorporated, scraping down the sides of the bowl 2 or 3 times. Add the eggs and yolks and process just until incorporated, about 5 seconds.8. Using the silicone spatula, scrape the filling into the prepared pan. Smooth the surface evenly with a small offset spatula. Set the pan in the larger pan and add enough very hot water to the larger pan to reach a depth of 1 inch.9. Bake the pumpkin cheesecake, turning the pan halfway after the first 25 minutes, for 45 minutes. Turn off the oven—without opening the door or peeking in any way—and let the cheesecake cool for 1 hour.10. Place the pan on a wire rack and let cool to room temperature, about 1 hour. Cover the cheesecake with a large overturned bowl or plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. To unmold the cheesecake, wipe the sides of the pan with a dish towel that youve run under hot water and wrung out and then carefully remove the side of the pan.Make the caramel glaze11. Have ready a 1-cup heatproof glass measure coated lightly with nonstick cooking spray.12. In a medium heavy saucepan, preferably nonstick, stir together the sugar, corn syrup, and water until all the sugar is moistened. Heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves and the syrup is bubbling. Stop stirring completely and allow the mixture to boil, undisturbed, until the mixture turns a deep amber [360°F (180°C) or a few degrees lower because its temperature will continue to rise]. Remove it from the heat and as soon as it reaches temperature, slowly and carefully pour the hot cream into the caramel. It will bubble up furiously. Use a silicone spatula or wooden spoon to stir the mixture gently, scraping the thicker part that settles on the bottom.13. Return the pan to very low heat, continuing to stir gently for 1 minute, until the mixture is uniform in color and the caramel is fully dissolved. Remove it from the heat and gently stir in the butter until incorporated. The mixture will be a little streaky but becomes uniform in color once cooled and stirred.14. Pour the caramel into the prepared glass measure and allow it to cool for 3 minutes. Gently stir in the vanilla and allow the caramel to cool until no longer warm to the touch, stirring gently 3 or 4 times. (The glaze keeps, covered, for up to 3 days at room temperature and for 3 months refrigerated. To reheat, place the caramel in a heatproof glass container, if it isn’t already in one, and place the container in a pan of simmering water until warm, about 7 minutes, or microwave it on high for 1 minute, stirring twice.)15. Pour the caramel glaze over the pumpkin cheesecake from the glass measure or, for greater precision, use a pastry bag fitted with a small decorating tip,or a resealable plastic bag with a very small semicircle cut from one corner. Slice and serve and be ready to listen to oohs and aahs.",

        "Have ready a fully baked pie crust.Beat sugar and butter for 10 to 15 minutes using the whisk attachment of a stand mixer. The goal is to make it less grainy.
